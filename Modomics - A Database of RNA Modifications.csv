METTL3 upregulation is reached by the downregulaion of miR-33a in NSCLC cells which normally reduces the expression of METTL3 by targeting its 3'UTR region.","A:m6A","METTL3","Non-small cell lung cancer"
"miR-143-3p is upregulated in the paired BM tissues as compared with that in primary cancer tissues. m6A methyltransferase Mettl3 can increase the splicing of precursor miR-143-3p to facilitate its biogenesis. It targets the three binding sites of 3’UTR of vasohibin-1 (VASH1) to inhibit its expression. Mechanistically, VASH1 can increase the ubiquitylation of VEGFA to trigger the proteasome mediated degradation, further, it can endow the tubulin depolymerization through detyrosination to increase the cell motility. Thus, miR-143-3p by inhibiting VASH1 t can increase the invasion capability and angiogenesis of lung cancer","A:m6A","METTL3","Non-small cell lung cancer"

The m6A modification regulated by WTAP led to post-transcriptional suppression of ETS1, with the implication of Hu-Antigen R (HuR) as an RNA stabilizer. Then ETS1 was found to inhibit the progression of HCC and could rescue the phenotype induced by WTAP deficiency.
